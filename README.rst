Flickr Bulk Uploader
--------------------


This application is useful for those users that want to upload a lot
of Photos to Flickr, for example, when you pay for an account and you
need to do the first import.

That was the reason for me to create this application.


How it works
------------

You need to create a config file called "settings.py" in the same
directory of the project with this line inside::

    PHOTOS_DIRECTORY = '/path/to/your/photos/directory'

Once you have created this file and run the applicacion, it will
search for all the subdirectories that don't have more
subdirectories and it will upload all the files inside them in a
PhotoSet with the name of this directory.

Example::

    /home/YOUR_USERNAME/fotos/
    ├── Sunny day
    │   ├── IMG_0016.JPG
    │   ├── IMG_0017.JPG
    │   ├── IMG_0018.JPG
    
    ......
    
    ├── Kayak
    │   ├── DSC01732.jpg
    │   ├── DSC01733.jpg
    │   ├── DSC01734.jpg
    
    ......
    
    ├── My birthday
    │   ├── My camera
    │   │   ├── IMG_0239.JPG
    │   │   ├── IMG_0240.JPG
    │   └── My brother's camera
    │       ├── IMG_0151.JPG
    
    ......
    
Whit this directory structure, "flickr-bulk-uploader.py" will create 4
PhotoSets with the names: "Sunny day", "Kayak", "My birthday".

Don't duplicate photos, please!
-------------------------------

If something wrong happens during the uploading proccess and it
stops; you can "resume" the last state by running it again without
uploading the same photos again. "flickr-bulk-upload.py" will check if
the Photo was already uploaded in the PhotoSet before to upload it.


Running the application
-----------------------

Just run it as a Python script::

    $ python flickr-bulk-uploader.py
